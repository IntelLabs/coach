    AdditiveNoise is an exploration policy intended for continuous action spaces. It takes the action from the agent

    can be given in two different ways:
    1. Specified by the user as a noise schedule which is taken in percentiles out of the action space size
    2. Specified by the agents action. In case the agents action is a list with 2 values, the 1st one is assumed to
    be the mean of the action, and 2nd is assumed to be its standard deviation.
