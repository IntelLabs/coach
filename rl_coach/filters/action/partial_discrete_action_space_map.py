    Partial map of two countable action spaces. For example, consider an environment
    with a MultiSelect action space (select multiple actions at the same time, such as jump and go right), with 8 actual
    MultiSelect actions. If we want the agent to be able to select only 5 of those actions by their index (0-4), we can
    map a discrete action space with 5 actions into the 5 selected MultiSelect actions. This will both allow the agent to
    use regular discrete actions, and mask 3 of the actions from the agent.
