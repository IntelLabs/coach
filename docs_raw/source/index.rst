Reinforcement Learning Coach
============================

Coach is a python framework which models the interaction between an agent and an environment in a modular way.
With Coach, it is possible to model an agent by combining various building blocks, and training the agent on multiple environments.
The available environments allow testing the agent in different fields such as robotics, autonomous driving, games and more.
It exposes a set of easy-to-use APIs for experimenting with new RL algorithms, and allows simple integration of
new environments to solve.
Coach collects statistics from the training process and supports advanced visualization techniques for debugging the agent being trained.
