Algorithms
==========

Coach supports many state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms, which are separated into three main classes -
value optimization, policy optimization and imitation learning.
A detailed description of those algorithms may be found in the `agents <../components/agents/index.html>`_ section.
