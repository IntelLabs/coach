<p><strong>“ok that’s prefect, but I am trying to build a solution for my application, how do I select the right algorithm?”</strong></p>

<h2>1. Does your environment have a discrete or continuous action space?<a class="headerlink" href="#does-your-environment-have-a-discrete-or-continuous-action-space" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Some reinforcement learning algorithms work only for discrete action spaces, where the agent needs to select
one out of several possible actions. Other algorithms work only for continuous action spaces, where there are
infinite possible actions, but there is some spatial relationship between the actions. And there are some algorithms
that can be applied in both cases. The available algorithms highly depend on the task at hand.</p>

<h2>2. Is collecting more samples from your environment painful?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-collecting-more-samples-from-your-environment-painful" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Reinforcement learning algorithm are notoriously known for the amount of samples they need for training.
Typically, on-policy algorithms are much less sample efficient compared to off-policy algorithms. But there are
other algorithmic features that allow improving the sample efficiency even more, like using a DND in NEC, or using
Hindsight Experience Replay. It is hard to say which algorithm is the most sample efficient, but we can at least say
which ones are not sample efficient.</p>

<p>Parallelizing training across multiple workers which are located on the same node or on different nodes is a technique
that has been introduced in recent years and achieved a lot of success in improving the results of multiple algorithms.
As part of this, there are some algorithms that don’t work well without being parallelized with multiple workers
working in parallel, which requires having a simulator for each worker.</p>

<h2>4. Do you have human demonstrations for solving the task?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-you-have-human-demonstrations-for-solving-the-task" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If human demonstrations are available for a task, most of the time it would be better to use those instead of training
using regular reinforcement learning from scratch. To use human demonstrations we have implemented several tools and
algorithms for imitation learning in Coach.</p>
