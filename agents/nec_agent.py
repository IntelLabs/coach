        this method modifies the superclass's behavior in only 3 ways:

        1) the embedding is saved and stored in self.current_episode_state_embeddings
        2) the dnd output head is only called if it has a minimum number of entries in it
            ideally, the dnd had would do this on its own, but in my attempt in encoding this
            behavior in tensorflow, I ran into problems. Would definitely be worth
            revisiting in the future
        3) during training, actions are saved and stored in self.current_episode_actions
            if behaviors 1 and 2 were handled elsewhere, this could easily be implemented
            as a wrapper around super instead of overriding this method entirelysearch
