    "Many real-world problems do not have a simulator modelling the environment, that the agent would be interacting with, in standard Reinforcement Learning. Instead, all we have is some data that was collected using some deployed policy, and we would like to use that data in order to learn a better policy for solving the problem. \n",

    "But, wait... If we don't have a simulator, how would we evaluate our newly learned policy and know if it is any good? Which algorithms should we be using in order to better address the problem of learning from a batch of data? Alternatively, what do we do if we don't have a simulator, but instead can actually deploy our policy on that real-world problem, and would just like to separate the new data collection from the learning a new policy part (i.e. if we have a system that can quite easily run inference, but is very hard to integrate a reinforcement learning framework with, such as Coach, for learning a new policy. **Can we have an actual example here? i.e. something like an oil company with nodes that can only do inference**), and iteratively train a better and better policy? \n",

In reality, we probably would already have a dataset of transitions of the form `<current_observation, action, reward, next_state>` to be used for learning a new agent. Ideally, we would also have, for each transtion, p(a|o) the probabilty of taking that action, given that transition's `current_observation`. "

    "Ignoring the prints around off-policy evaluation for now (we'll return to it in a bit), we first see Coach running a long heatup of 50,000 steps (as we have defined a `DATASET_SIZE` of 50,000 in the preliminaries section), in order to collect a dataset of random actions. Then, we can see Coach training a supervised reward model that is needed for OPE (off-policy evaluation). Last, Coach starts using the collected dataset of experience to train a Double DQN agent. Since, for this environment, we actually do have a simulator, Coach will be using it to evaluate the learned policy. As you can probably see, since this is a very simple environment, a dataset of just random actions is enough to get a Double DQN agent training, and reaching rewards of less than -100 (actually solving the environment). As you can also probably notice, the learning is not very stable, and if you'll take a look at the Q values predicted by the agent (e.g. in Coach Dashboard; this tutorial experiment results are under the `tutorials` folder), you will be seeing them unboundedly increasing. This is caused due to the Batch RL based learning where not interacting with the environment any further, while randomly exposing only small parts of the MDP in the dataset, makes learning even harder than standard Off-Policy RL. This phenomena is very nicely explained in [Off-Policy Deep Reinforcement Learning without Exploration](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.02900). We have implemented a discrete-actions variant of [Batch Constrained Q-Learning](https://github.com/NervanaSystems/coach/blob/master/rl_coach/agents/ddqn_bcq_agent.py), which helps with mitigating this issue. \n",

    "Next, let's switch to a dataset containing data combined from several 'deployed' policies, as is often the case in real-world scenarios, where we usually already have some policy (hopefully not a random one) in-place and we want to improve upon. For instance, a recommender system already using some policy for gemerating recommendations, and we want to use Batch RL to acquire a better and improved policy. <br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We will demonstrate that by training an agent, and using its replay buffer content as the dataset from which we will learn a new agent, based solely on that data (without any further interaction with the environment). This should allow for both a better trained agent and for more meaningful Off-Policy Evaluation (as the more extensive your input data is, i.e. exposing more of the MDP, the better is the evaluation of a new agent based on it. In other words - garbage-in, garbage-out).\n"
