    "Alternatively, Coach can be used a library directly from python. As described above, Coach uses the presets mechanism to define the experiments. A preset is essentially a python module which instantiates a `GraphManager` object. The graph manager is a container that holds the agents and the environments, and has some additional parameters for running the experiment, such as visualization parameters. The graph manager acts as the scheduler which orchestrates the experiment.\n",
